Submit a python file for a solution to the below problem along with a write-up explaining 
your work and time complexities (just like normal HW!)

```
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
*Note that the answer must be a substring (e.g. "abcd" is a subsequence of “abbbcccd”, not a substring).

Examples:
“abcabcbb” → 3 ("abc", with the length of 3)
“bbbbb” → 1 ("b", with the length of 1.)
“pwwkew” → 3 ("wke", with the length of 3.)

Edge Cases:
“” → 0
null → throw exception or 0
